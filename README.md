BrailleIO
=========

BrailleIO is a small .NET framework for developing two-dimensional tactile applications. It offers general features for displaying tactile information and for interaction. BrailleIO includes hardware abstraction, window and visualization features as well as basic interaction functions, such as panning and zooming on different content types. 

Information visualization can be organized in several independent screens that can be divided into multiple areas, having a full box model. Interaction can be realized via hardware keys of the used device or by basic gestures if the device is touch-sensitive.
